            <p>noun: the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies interpreted as having an influence on human affairs and the natural world</p>
            <p>For centuries, humans have looked to the heavens for guidance. Astrology can be used as a powerful and fun tool for understanding ourselves, others, and the world around us. This site provides guidance in three different areas: Horoscope, Moon Phases, and Tarot Card Reading.</p>
            <h1>Horoscope</h1>
            <p>A horoscope uses an astrological chart calculated from the planetary positions. The calculations are based on the date, place and time of birth. That is why horoscopes are extremely personal, like a fingerprint.</p>

            <p>The phase the moon is in has a huge influence on your life, mindset, and mood. Working with the moon can strengthen our natural instincts.</p>
